Partner 1 (Randy Jama):
Wrote module and testbenches for ALU and shifter
Produced wave.do files for ALU and shifter
Datapath file: wrote the comments and all inputs/outputs/wires involved
Wrote the LAB4-based section of the verilog code in lab5_top.v

Partner 2 (Osama Dawood):
Wrote Register File module and testbench
Produced wave.do files for Resister File module
Datapath file: wrote general structure, as well as the MUX's involved
Wrote the testbench for lab5_top (though both were present during writing)

Both:
Wrote the datapath that connected all pieces (we took turns writing actual verilog code for practice)
Troubleshooted our respective modules if errors occured that the other partner could nto fix.
Created the testbench cases and debugged any issues together.
Loaded the file into the DE1-SoC for testing and troubleshooting. If an error went wrong we
would both go back to the code and try to find/fix the issue.
